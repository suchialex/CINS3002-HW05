## The objective of this homework assignment is
- to write the contents of the file (employees.csv) to a multi-dimensional list
- we will add new employees to this list
- we will lookup employee from this list
- we will update employee data in this list
- we will delete employee from this list
- we will display employees from this list
- after all these operations are done, we will write this list back to the file

üö© Note: Changes will not reflect in the file immediately. You will see the changes in the list.

    ‚úÖ Get everything started
  </summary>

  - Copy main.py, validations.py, functions.py, list_functions.py from HW04
  - We won't be using functions.py or list_functions.py, but it will be nice to have all your modules in one place
  - Download employees.csv from https://github.com/suchialex/CINS3002-HW05/blob/main/employees.csv
  - Download suchi_pretty_print.py if you need it https://github.com/suchialex/CINS3002-HW05/blob/main/suchi_pretty_print.py
  - Create a new file named multilist_functions.py, write an import statement to import the validations module
  - In **main.py** edit the import statement to import from multilist_functions module

## In multilist_functions.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define employee_operations()
  </summary>

  - It is a void function that takes no parameters
  - Write print statement to print `Employee Management`
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define function file_to_list
  </summary>
  
  - **Objective**: This function will read the contents of the employees.csv file line by line and split each line into a list using the delimiter ; and  store this list in a list. This multi-dimensional list is returned to the calling function.
  - This function does not accept any parameters and returns a list
  - In the function body,
    - First, create an empty list (this list will contain all the employees data)
    - Using the context manager, open the file employees.csv in read mode and store it in a file pointer
      - üö© Use exception handling since file is being opened in read mode (in the except clause, print `file not found` and return an empty list)
    - Using this file pointer, start a for loop with a loop variable of your choice (this variable will read each line of the file)
      - Remove the newline character from the loop variable
      - Convert the string stored in the loop variable to a list using the delimiter ‚è© 7-20b
        - üö© Name this list differently than the empty list above
      - Now append this list to the empty list you created above
    - Outside the for loop return the list
    - Using list comprehension rewrite the above statements as concisely as possible ‚è© 7-25
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Call the function file_to_list()
  </summary>

   - Inside employee_operations(), after the print statement, call the file_to_list()
   - Store the returned list in a variable
   - Print the returned list (you may use suchi_print(), after importing it)
   - üìú Test your code
     - See if the multi-dimensional list is being printed correctly
     - Clear the contents of the file and ensure an empty list is printed (üö© replace the contents after testing)
     - Misspell the file name and ensure an empty list is printed
</details>

  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define display_employees()
  </summary>
  
  - The objective of this function is to display all employees in a tabular format
  - This function takes one parameter - the employee multi-dimensional list
  - This function returns nothing, so it is a void function
  - In the function body
    - Start a for loop to go over the multi-dimensional list, choose a name for the loop variable
    - Using the appropriate indices of the loop variable, print ID, Name, Department and Salary in a formatted tabular fashion

  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Call display_employees()
  </summary>
  
  - Inside employee_operations(), after the call to file_to_list() function, call the display_employees() by passing the employees list (obtained from the file_to_list function) as an argument
  - üìú Test your code - all employee data should be displayed in a tabular format
  - If code executes correctly, you may comment out this function call

    - Check if there are any employees in the list, if not, return a default numeric string, maybe `1234` ‚è© Tutorial: 7-12
    - Get the last employee from the multidimesional list and store it in a variable (this will be a list) ‚è© Tutorial: 7-6b
    - Get the first element of from the list above, that is the last employee ID and store in a variable ‚è© Tutorial: 7-6a
    - üí° You may consolidate the above two steps into one by using two sets of square brackets
    - Convert it to an integer and add 1 to it
    - Return this after converting it to a string
